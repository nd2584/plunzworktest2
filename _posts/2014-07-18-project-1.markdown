description: This guide represents the work of a graduate research seminar given in the Spring 2015 at Columbia University. It engaged graduate and postgraduate students in urban design and engineering. The mandate was to fill a gap in considering the possibilities for infrastructural development in Manyatta; a gap that involves the most basic tools such that immediate concerns can be addressed by those most immediately deprived. In this regard, Manyatta is special, as an environment where residents, of dire necessity, are already developing their own skills for nurturing social capital and enterprise. What has been lacking is technical know-how needed for improving the infrastructural lifeblood that connects to houses, streets and neighborhoods.
